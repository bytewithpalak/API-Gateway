# API Gateway — Self-Service Rate-Limiting Layer for Web APIs

A lightweight, self-service API Gateway that sits between clients and an existing API to provide **rate limiting, request protection, authentication, logging, and analytics** without requiring changes to the target API.

## 🚀 Overview

Uncontrolled API traffic can lead to:

* Resource exhaustion
* Unexpected infrastructure and API costs
* Unfair resource usage between clients
* Service degradation caused by excessive requests

This project addresses these problems by providing a deployable **reverse proxy with distributed rate limiting**. Developers can register their APIs, configure request limits, and expose them through a protected gateway endpoint.

The gateway forwards allowed requests to the target API and automatically returns **HTTP 429 — Too Many Requests** when a client's request budget is exhausted.

```

The gateway uses Spring Cloud Gateway for the proxy layer, Redis for distributed counter state, PostgreSQL for persistent data, and React for the analytics interface.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. A developer creates an account and logs in.
2. The developer registers a target API.
3. A gateway endpoint and API key are generated.
4. The developer configures a request limit.
5. A client sends requests through the gateway.
6. The gateway checks the client's rate-limit policy.
7. Redis/Bucket4j performs an atomic consume-or-reject operation.
8. If allowed, the request is forwarded to the target API.
9. If the limit is exceeded, the gateway returns **HTTP 429**.
10. Request outcomes are recorded in PostgreSQL.
11. The dashboard displays aggregated traffic and request statistics.

## 🚦 Rate-Limiting Algorithms

### Token Bucket

The token bucket maintains a bucket with a fixed capacity and refill rate.

```text
Bucket Capacity = 10 requests
Refill Rate     = 5 requests/sec

Client
  │
  ├── Request → Token available → ✅ Forward
  ├── Request → Token available → ✅ Forward
  └── Request → No token         → ❌ HTTP 429
```

This allows controlled bursts while maintaining a bounded long-term request rate.

### Sliding Window

The sliding-window algorithm counts requests within a moving time interval and rejects requests once the configured threshold is reached.

The project supports both approaches so their behavior can be evaluated under identical workloads.

## 📁 Project Structure

```text
api-gateway/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main/
│   │   │   └── java/
│   │   └── test/

│   └── Dockerfile
│
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

> The exact folder structure may change as implementation progresses.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application requires configuration for:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=

# Gateway
GATEWAY_BASE_URL=
```

**Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository.**

Use environment variables or platform-managed secret configuration instead.

## 🧪 Testing

The project emphasizes correctness under concurrent load.

Testing includes:

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Redis-backed rate-limit tests
* Concurrent request tests
* Multi-instance gateway tests
* API testing using Postman
* Automated CI testing

The primary evaluation metric is **Enforcement Accuracy under Concurrent Load**.

### Target

For a configured limit of `N` requests:

```text
Expected admitted requests ≈ N ± 2%
```

The test is performed with multiple gateway instances and significantly more concurrent requests than the configured limit.

## 📈 Performance Targets

| Metric                          |  Target |
| ------------------------------- | ------: |
| Rate-limit enforcement accuracy |     ±2% |
| p95 added latency               | ≤ 50 ms |
| Request log completeness        | ≥ 99.9% |
| Staging availability            |   ≥ 99% |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

The gateway is designed to prevent misuse of the proxy:

* JWT authentication for users
* Registered APIs only
* Target URL validation
* Credentials stored securely
* Secrets excluded from source control
* No arbitrary proxying to unregistered hosts
* Explicit Redis failure policy

These measures reduce the risk of the gateway being abused as an open proxy.

## 📦 Deployment

The proposed deployment architecture uses managed infrastructure:

```text
                    GitHub
                      │
                      ▼
               GitHub Actions
                      │
              ┌───────┴───────┐
              ▼               ▼
          Backend          Frontend
        Render/Railway       Vercel
              │
       ┌──────┴──────┐
       ▼             ▼
     Redis       PostgreSQL
```

The backend can be containerized and horizontally replicated, while Redis stores shared rate-limiting state and PostgreSQL stores persistent application data.

## 📄 Project Proposal

This implementation is based on the project proposal **“API Gateway: A Self-Service Rate-Limiting Layer for Web APIs”**, submitted for UCS503P on August 8, 2026.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> Build a lightweight, deployable API protection layer that allows developers to enforce fair request budgets in front of an existing API without modifying the API itself.

The primary engineering focus is **correct distributed rate limiting, measurable performance, reliability, and scalability**, rather than developing a new rate-limiting algorithm.
